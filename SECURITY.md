# Security Policy

Remember
The program only turns on WpcMonSvc service , which when turned off may not completely disable parental controls on the device.

The program only turns off the service locally on the computer (it is not a program that has an illegal operation). To be more sure that parental control does not work, configure the Firewall to block parental control (Windows defaults to built-in Firewall).
